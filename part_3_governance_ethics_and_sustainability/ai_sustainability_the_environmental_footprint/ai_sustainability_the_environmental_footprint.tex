\chapter{AI Sustainability: The Environmental Footprint}
\label{chap:ai_sustainability}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:sustainability_introduction}
As Artificial Intelligence continues its rapid ascent, its environmental footprint is becoming an increasingly critical consideration. While AI offers immense potential to address global challenges, including climate change, its development and deployment come with significant energy consumption and resource demands. This chapter will explore the hidden environmental costs of AI, its specific impact on critical industries, the paradoxical role of AI as a tool for sustainability, and the pathways towards developing and deploying AI in a more environmentally responsible manner.

\section{The Hidden Costs of AI: Energy and Resources}
\label{sec:hidden_costs_of_ai}
The environmental impact of AI is substantial, primarily due to its significant energy consumption and resource usage across its lifecycle, from hardware manufacturing to model training and inference \parencite{WikipediaAISustainability2023}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption:} AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, demand immense computational power. Training these models can consume millions of kilowatt-hours, leading to significant electricity consumption. Data centers, which house the necessary computing infrastructure, are major energy consumers, with projections indicating their global electricity consumption could rise significantly \parencite{IEA2025}.
    \item \textbf{Carbon Footprint:} The high energy demand translates into a considerable carbon footprint, especially when data centers rely on fossil fuels for power. Training a single large AI model can generate hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, comparable to the annual emissions of numerous cars \parencite{ColumbiaEdu2023}.
    \item \textbf{Water Usage:} Cooling the hardware in AI data centers requires substantial amounts of water. For instance, training a single generative AI model can consume as much as 284,000 liters of water, posing a significant problem in regions facing water scarcity \parencite{Li2023}.
    \item \textbf{Resource Depletion and E-waste:} The production of AI hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and servers, is resource-intensive, requiring the extraction of specialized metals and contributing to environmental degradation. The relatively short lifespan of these components leads to a growing problem of electronic waste (e-waste), with projections suggesting millions of tonnes of e-waste by 2030 \parencite{Wang2024}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Impact on Critical Industries}
\label{sec:sustainability_impact}

The growing environmental footprint of AI has direct implications for critical industries. A comprehensive list of risks and challenges is available in the Master Risk Register (Appendix \ref{app:master_risk_register}). Key impacts on critical industries include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increased Energy Demand
    \item Water Scarcity Concerns
    \item Supply Chain Pressures
    \item Reputational Risk
\end{itemize}

For a detailed description of each impact and potential mitigation strategies, please refer to the Master Risk Register in Appendix \ref{app:master_risk_register}.

\section{AI as a Tool for Sustainability}
\label{sec:ai_for_sustainability}
Paradoxically, AI also offers powerful solutions to address environmental challenges and promote sustainability across various critical industries \parencite{IBM2023Sustainability}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy and Resource Optimization:} AI can optimize energy usage in smart grids, balance supply and demand, integrate renewable energy sources more efficiently, and improve waste management in data centers \parencite{Intel2023}. It can also refine industrial processes to reduce carbon intensity and optimize energy consumption in buildings and factories \parencite{Artefact2023}.
    \item \textbf{Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation:} AI helps track carbon emissions, analyze complex climate data, improve weather forecasting, and provide early warning systems for extreme weather events \parencite{AIMultiple2023}. It also aids in optimizing renewable energy output and performance \parencite{RipiKAI2023}.
    \item \textbf{Waste Management and Circular Economy:} AI can optimize waste management systems, increase recycling rates, and identify opportunities to reduce waste in business processes. It supports a circular economy by monitoring resources and predicting equipment maintenance requirements \parencite{Fang2023}.
    \item \textbf{Biodiversity and Conservation:} AI improves biodiversity monitoring and conservation by analyzing data on species populations, habitats, and threats, helping researchers detect and identify animals \parencite{WEForum2023}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pathways to Sustainable AI}
\label{sec:sustainable_ai_pathways}
Achieving sustainable AI development and deployment requires a multi-faceted approach that minimizes AI's environmental footprint while leveraging its capabilities for broader sustainability goals \parencite{SopraSteria2025}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Green AI Practices:} This involves optimizing algorithms for energy efficiency, reducing model size, utilizing low-power hardware, and employing data-efficient techniques like transfer learning \parencite{AccessPartnership2023}.
    \item \textbf{Renewable Energy and Green Infrastructure:} Prioritizing the use of renewable energy sources to power data centers and AI infrastructure. Many tech companies are committing to carbon-free operations \parencite{Exaud2023}.
    \item \textbf{Ethical AI Considerations:} Ensuring transparency, explainability, fairness, and bias mitigation in AI systems. This includes rigorous scrutiny of training data and adherence to data privacy regulations \parencite{AlgorithmWatch2023}.
    \item \textbf{Governance and Policy Frameworks:} Establishing robust governance structures and ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment. This includes educating employees on AI ethics and sustainability principles and aligning AI strategies with clear sustainability goals \parencite{PMI2025}.
    \item \textbf{Life Cycle Approach:} Considering the environmental impact across the entire AI lifecycle, from development and training to deployment and disposal, and encouraging the reuse and adaptation of existing models \parencite{ProfileTree2023}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

The global food and agriculture sector faces immense challenges, including feeding a growing population, adapting to climate change, and ensuring sustainable practices. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative technology that can address these issues by enhancing efficiency, optimising resource use, and improving food safety and quality. This chapter explores the diverse applications of AI across the food and agriculture value chain, from precision farming and crop monitoring to food processing and supply chain management \parencite{kumar2025reviewai}.

\section{Key Applications of AI in Food and Agriculture}

\subsection{Precision Agriculture}

Precision agriculture leverages AI to optimise farming practices by providing highly localised and data-driven insights. AI-powered systems analyse data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery to monitor soil conditions, crop health, and weather patterns. This enables farmers to apply water, fertilisers, and pesticides precisely where and when they are needed, reducing waste, minimising environmental impact, and increasing yields. Robotics, guided by AI, can perform tasks such as automated planting, weeding, and harvesting with unprecedented accuracy \parencite{subedi2023ai}.

\subsection{Crop and Soil Monitoring}

AI plays a crucial role in continuous monitoring of crops and soil, allowing for early detection of potential problems. Computer vision and machine learning algorithms can analyse images captured by drones or ground-based sensors to identify signs of disease, pest infestations, or nutrient deficiencies in crops. Similarly, AI can assess soil moisture levels, nutrient content, and overall soil health, providing farmers with actionable insights to maintain optimal growing conditions and prevent crop losses \parencite{singh2024artificial}.

\subsection{Predictive Analytics and Yield Optimisation}

AI's ability to process and analyse vast datasets enables advanced predictive analytics for agriculture. Machine learning models can forecast crop yields based on historical data, weather predictions, and environmental factors, helping farmers to plan for harvesting, storage, and market sales. Beyond yield, AI can also predict market demand and price fluctuations, assisting farmers in making informed decisions about planting schedules and sales strategies to maximise profitability \parencite{kumar2025reviewai}.

\subsection{Food Processing and Manufacturing}

In the food processing and manufacturing industry, AI enhances quality control, efficiency, and safety. AI-powered computer vision systems can inspect food products on production lines to detect defects, foreign objects, or inconsistencies in size and shape with high speed and accuracy. Predictive maintenance algorithms, driven by AI, can monitor machinery to anticipate failures, reducing downtime and ensuring continuous operation \parencite{subedi2023ai}.

\subsection{Supply Chain and Logistics}

AI is streamlining the complex food supply chain, from farm to fork. AI algorithms can optimise logistics by forecasting demand, planning efficient delivery routes, and managing inventory to minimise waste and spoilage. For perishable goods, AI-integrated sensors can monitor environmental conditions during transport, ensuring product quality and safety. Furthermore, AI can enhance traceability within the supply chain, providing transparency and enabling rapid response to food safety incidents \parencite{singh2024artificial}.

\subsection{Livestock Management}

AI applications are also transforming livestock management. AI-powered systems can monitor the health, behaviour, and welfare of individual animals using sensors and cameras. This allows for early detection of illnesses, optimisation of feeding regimes, and improved breeding practices. By providing real-time insights into animal well-being, AI contributes to better animal welfare and more efficient livestock production \parencite{kumar2025reviewai}.

\section{Conclusion}

Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionise the food and agriculture sector, offering innovative solutions to address some of the most pressing global challenges. By enabling more precise, efficient, and sustainable practices, AI can help to ensure food security, reduce environmental impact, and improve the quality and safety of our food supply. However, the successful adoption of AI in this sector will require addressing challenges related to data availability, infrastructure, and the need for new skills. A collaborative approach among stakeholders will be essential to harness the full potential of AI for a more resilient and sustainable food system.

\label{cha:ai_in_water}

\section{Introduction}

The water sector is facing unprecedented challenges, from growing water scarcity and pollution to ageing infrastructure and the impacts of climate change. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool to help address these challenges, offering new ways to manage our precious water resources more efficiently and sustainably. This chapter provides an overview of the key applications of AI in the water sector, from optimising water treatment and distribution to improving water quality monitoring and forecasting \parencite{hussain2024artificial}.

\section{Key Applications of AI in the Water Sector}

\subsection{Water Resource Management and Conservation}

AI can play a crucial role in managing water resources more effectively. AI-powered systems can analyse data from satellites, weather stations, and sensors to forecast water availability and demand, helping water managers to make more informed decisions about water allocation. In agriculture, AI can be used to optimise irrigation, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time, which can lead to significant water savings \parencite{goyal2020review}.

\subsection{Water and Wastewater Treatment}

AI is also being used to optimise the performance of water and wastewater treatment plants. AI algorithms can analyse data from sensors to monitor and control treatment processes in real-time, ensuring that water is treated to the required standards while minimising the use of energy and chemicals. For example, AI can be used to control the aeration process in wastewater treatment, which can account for a significant portion of a plant's energy consumption \parencite{satoh2023can}.

\subsection{Smart Water Grids and Distribution}

AI is a key enabling technology for the development of smart water grids. By deploying sensors and smart meters throughout the water distribution network, water utilities can collect vast amounts of data on water flow, pressure, and quality. AI can then be used to analyse this data to detect leaks, predict pipe bursts, and optimise the operation of the network. This can help to reduce water losses, improve the resilience of the water supply, and reduce the costs of operating and maintaining the network \parencite{hussain2024artificial}.

\subsection{Water Quality Monitoring and Forecasting}

AI is also being used to improve our ability to monitor and forecast water quality. AI models can be trained to predict the concentration of various pollutants in rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, based on data from sensors and other sources. This can help to provide early warning of pollution events, identify the sources of pollution, and assess the effectiveness of pollution control measures. By providing more accurate and timely information on water quality, AI can help to protect public health and the environment \parencite{goyal2020review}.

\section{Challenges and the Future}

Despite the significant potential of AI in the water sector, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed. These include the need for more and better data, the lack of standardisation in data formats and protocols, and the need for a skilled workforce that can develop and manage AI-based systems. There are also important ethical considerations that need to be addressed, such as the potential for algorithmic bias and the need for transparency and accountability in decision-making. Overcoming these challenges will require a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including water utilities, technology providers, regulators, and researchers \parencite{hussain2024artificial}.

\section{Conclusion}

Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise the water sector, helping us to manage our water resources more efficiently, sustainably, and equitably. From optimising water treatment to predicting floods, the applications of AI are vast and varied. However, realising the full potential of AI in the water sector will require a concerted effort to address the associated challenges. By working together, we can harness the power of AI to create a more water-secure future for all.

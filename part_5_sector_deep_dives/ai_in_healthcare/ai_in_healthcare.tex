\section{Introduction}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionise the healthcare industry, offering the potential to improve patient outcomes, increase efficiency, and accelerate medical innovation. From analysing medical images to personalising treatment plans, AI applications are already being integrated into various aspects of healthcare delivery. This chapter provides an overview of the key applications of AI in healthcare, explores the transformative potential of these technologies, and discusses the critical ethical and practical challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and responsible adoption \parencite{jiang2017artificial}.

\section{Key Applications of AI in Healthcare}

\subsection{Medical Imaging and Diagnosis}

One of the most mature applications of AI in healthcare is in the field of medical imaging. AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models, have demonstrated remarkable success in analysing medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. These systems can assist radiologists in detecting and diagnosing diseases, such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy, with high accuracy, often exceeding human performance. By automating the analysis of medical images, AI can help to reduce diagnostic errors, improve efficiency, and enable earlier detection of life-threatening conditions \parencite{mintz2019introduction}.

\subsection{Drug Discovery and Development}

The process of developing new drugs is notoriously long, expensive, and prone to failure. AI has the potential to significantly accelerate this process by identifying promising drug candidates, predicting their efficacy and toxicity, and optimising clinical trial design. By analysing vast datasets of biological and chemical information, AI can help researchers to identify novel drug targets and design new molecules with desired therapeutic properties, ultimately leading to faster development of new treatments for a wide range of diseases \parencite{jiang2017artificial}.

\subsection{Personalised Medicine and Treatment}

AI is a key enabler of personalised medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. By analysing a patient's genetic information, lifestyle, and clinical data, AI algorithms can help clinicians to select the most effective treatment, predict disease risk, and develop personalised prevention strategies. This approach has the potential to improve treatment outcomes, reduce adverse drug reactions, and empower patients to take a more active role in their own healthcare \parencite{jiang2017artificial}.

\subsection{Administrative Tasks and Clinical Workflow}

Beyond clinical applications, AI can also help to streamline administrative tasks and optimise clinical workflows. AI-powered tools can automate tasks such as medical record documentation, appointment scheduling, and billing, freeing up clinicians to spend more time with patients. By analysing electronic health records, AI can also help to identify patients at high risk of disease, predict patient flows, and optimise resource allocation in hospitals and clinics \parencite{mintz2019introduction}.

\section{Ethical and Practical Challenges}

The transformative potential of AI in healthcare is accompanied by a range of ethical and practical challenges. These include concerns about data privacy and security, the potential for algorithmic bias to exacerbate health disparities, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks to ensure the safety and efficacy of AI-based medical devices. Building trust among clinicians and patients is also a critical challenge, requiring transparency in how AI models are developed and used. Addressing these challenges will require a multi-stakeholder approach involving policymakers, regulators, healthcare professionals, and the public \parencite{australian2025safe}.

\section{Conclusion}

Artificial intelligence has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift in healthcare, leading to more accurate diagnoses, more effective treatments, and more efficient healthcare systems. However, the successful integration of AI into clinical practice will require careful consideration of the ethical, social, and regulatory implications. By embracing a responsible and human-centred approach to AI development and deployment, we can unlock the full potential of this transformative technology to improve the health and well-being of people around the world.
